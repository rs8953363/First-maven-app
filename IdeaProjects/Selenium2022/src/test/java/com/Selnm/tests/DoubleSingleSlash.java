public class DoubleSingleSlash {
   /* xpath is a locator, it's like moving step by step in the HTML frame by slashes/
    // tagName[@attribute = "value"]

    /html/body/div/header/div/div/div/div/a --> Absolute path (not commonly used)
    //header/div/div/div/div/a --> Relative path.
The diff btw two is abs path starts with /, relative path starts with //.  / represents child, it searches all child elements,
// searches child elements and their children
    *///
