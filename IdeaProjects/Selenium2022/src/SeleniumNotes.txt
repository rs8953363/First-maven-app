WebElement: All the items you can right-click and inspect

14. *How to change a WebElement's text or delete? With clear() method
*How to change an input's text? With JavaScript's innerText method

15.*How to get all the options in dropdown?
    1. Use Select class and ID attribute.
    2. There are options under Select class and they are witten with option tag. You can use it.
    3. You can use both value attribute and text.
            Driver.getDriver().get("hyyps://amazon.com");
            WebElement dropdown = Driver.getDriver().findElement(By.id("searchDropdownBox"));

            Select select = new Select(dropdown);
            select.getOptions();//Helps you to get all options as a list
            for (WebElement w : options)
                        System.out.println(w.getText());

   *How to get one of the options from the dropdown? Use Select class, and then use selectByIndex(), selectByVisibleText(),
   or selectByValue options. To find the first element, you can use getFirstSelectedOption
   *How to check if the options are in alphabetical order or not? After creating an object in Select class, create a
   method which returns a boolean value. You can go through the options with for loop
16. What would you do if you click on a link and it opened on a new window?
    I would use WindowsHandle as there is a code for each window. By using that code, I move between windows with the help
    of switch method. Driver.getDriver().switchTo().window(pageHandleValue)
17. How to check an alert in Selenium? If you cannot do a left or right click or anything on the page, then it's an alert
    created by JavaScript. In this case, you need to switch to that alert and close it, otherwise you cannot do anything.
    If you can do right-click and inspect, then it's created by HTML. You go to website, switch to alert, and either
    accept, reject, or use sendKeys method to send an input. Driver.getDriver().switchTo().alert().accept();
           //dismiss() --> rejects alert
           //accept() -->accepts alert
           // sendKeys() --> add text into input.

18. How to prioritize tests in Test NG? According to alphabetical order or top to bottom. If you put the priorty and the
priority is low, then that test runs first.
19. How to test a color of a WebElement?
